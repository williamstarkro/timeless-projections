# Placeholder for now.
# Eventually will be built to calculate user(service provider) value
# User value generated from following components:
# - Projected lifetime on system
# - Average earnings on a job
# - Spending on the system
# - Frequency of jobs on system
# - Law of Diminishing Returns for marginal user in a field (all plumbers and a new plumber joins won't be linear growth)
# The assumption is that all tools/equipment/materials are either commoditized or priced outside the network
